# Welcome to the New Site

This is a sample post to demonstrate the new StackToHeap site built with Astro. The site has been migrated from Jekyll to Astro, bringing modern web development practices and improved performance.

## What's New?

### Modern Stack

- **Astro**: A modern static site generator with excellent performance
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development experience
- **MDX**: Enhanced Markdown with component support

### Key Features

1. **Fast Performance**: Astro ships zero JavaScript by default
2. **Modern Styling**: shadcn-inspired components with Tailwind CSS
3. **Dark Mode**: Automatic dark mode support based on system preferences
4. **SEO Optimized**: Built-in SEO components and sitemap generation

### URL Structure Preserved

The migration maintains the original Jekyll URL structure:
```
/blog/:year/:month/:day/:title/
```

This ensures all existing links continue to work without redirects.

## Code Example

Here's a simple code block to test syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to StackToHeap.`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next?

The next steps include:
- Migrating all existing blog posts
- Setting up CI/CD for automated deployments
- Adding analytics and comments integration
- Optimizing images and assets

Stay tuned for more updates!
