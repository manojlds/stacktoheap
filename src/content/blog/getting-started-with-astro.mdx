# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that focuses on delivering fast, content-focused websites with minimal JavaScript. Let's explore why it's an excellent choice for blogs and content sites.

## Why Astro?

### Performance First

Astro's philosophy is simple: **ship less JavaScript**. By default, Astro:

- Generates static HTML at build time
- Only hydrates components that need interactivity
- Supports partial hydration with "Islands Architecture"

### Developer Experience

```javascript
// Astro components are intuitive
---
const greeting = "Hello, Astro!";
---

<div class="greeting">
  <h1>{greeting}</h1>
</div>
```

### Framework Agnostic

Astro supports multiple frameworks in the same project:
- React
- Vue
- Svelte
- Solid
- Preact

## Key Features

1. **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management
2. **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, CSS bundling
3. **Markdown & MDX**: First-class support for content
4. **Integrations**: Easy setup for Tailwind, sitemap, RSS, etc.

## Setting Up a Project

```bash
npm create astro@latest
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it! You have a running Astro site.

## Performance Comparison

| Framework | Lighthouse Score | Time to Interactive |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Astro     | 100             | < 1s                |
| Next.js   | 92              | 2.1s                |
| Gatsby    | 89              | 2.8s                |
